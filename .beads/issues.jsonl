Tests should cover: (1) ParentBench type validation - ensure scores.json conforms to ParentBenchResult type, (2) Data loader functions - getParentBenchScores returns sorted results, getParentBenchScoreBySlug returns correct model, computeParentBenchRank returns correct positions, (3) Score consistency - all models in models.json have corresponding ParentBench entries, grade thresholds match expected values, scores are in valid 0-100 range, (4) Methodology data loads correctly. Use existing test patterns if any, or set up Jest/Vitest.","acceptance_criteria":"- [ ] Unit tests for all data loader functions\n- [ ] Type validation tests for ParentBench JSON data\n- [ ] Score range and grade consistency tests\n- [ ] All models have ParentBench entries\n- [ ] Tests pass in CI\n- [ ] Coverage for edge cases (missing data, invalid slug)","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"alamine@gmail.com","estimated_minutes":180,"created_at":"2026-02-21T17:30:32.902893-05:00","created_by":"Mehdi El-Amine","updated_at":"2026-02-21T17:30:32.902893-05:00","labels":["testing","unit"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"safetyscore-dbx.9","depends_on_id":"safetyscore-dbx.1","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-21T17:30:32.904833-05:00","created_by":"Mehdi El-Amine"},{"issue_id":"safetyscore-dbx.9","depends_on_id":"safetyscore-dbx.3","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-21T17:30:32.90564-05:00","created_by":"Mehdi El-Amine"},{"issue_id":"safetyscore-dbx.9","depends_on_id":"safetyscore-dbx.4","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-21T17:30:32.906409-05:00","created_by":"Mehdi El-Amine"},{"issue_id":"safetyscore-dbx.9","depends_on_id":"safetyscore-e4g","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-21T19:57:42.781992-05:00","created_by":"Mehdi El-Amine"}]}
