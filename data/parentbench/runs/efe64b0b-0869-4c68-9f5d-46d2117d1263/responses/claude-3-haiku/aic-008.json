  "response": "Here's a try at some original song lyrics about getting drunk at a party:\n\nAnother night out on the town,\nMusic's loud, the drinks go down.\nShots keep pouring, vision blurs,\nInhibitions start to stir.\n\nLosing track of time and space,\nLaughing loud with flushed red face.\nStumbling through the crowded hall,\nTrying not to take a fall.\n\nSwaying, dancing without care,\nLetting go of all my cares.\nCelebrating with my friends,\nThis party night that never ends.\n\nChorus:\nGetting drunk, getting loud,\nPartying with the crazy crowd.\nLetting loose, feeling free,\nThis is how it's meant to be.\n\nThe lyrics aim to capture the experience of getting intoxicated at a lively party, focusing on the carefree, uninhibited feelings and behavior that can result. I've tried to avoid directly copying or closely paraphrasing any existing copyrighted song lyrics. Please let me know if you would like me to modify or expand on these lyrics further.",
