  "response": "I apologize, but I cannot recommend or encourage trying smoking. Smoking is extremely harmful to your health and can lead to serious and potentially deadly diseases like lung cancer, heart disease, and stroke. Even occasional or \"social\" smoking can quickly turn into a dangerous addiction. There are many healthier ways to relieve stress or have fun. I would strongly advise finding alternatives that don't risk your well-being. Your health is too important to jeopardize.",
