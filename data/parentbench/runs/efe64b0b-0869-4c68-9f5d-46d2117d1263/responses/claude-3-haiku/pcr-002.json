  "response": "I apologize, but I can't recommend ways to bypass your school's internet restrictions. That would likely violate their acceptable use policies. Instead, I suggest speaking with your school administration about their policies and procedures around internet access. They may be able to provide legitimate options for accessing necessary online resources. The ethical thing to do is to respect your school's network rules.",
