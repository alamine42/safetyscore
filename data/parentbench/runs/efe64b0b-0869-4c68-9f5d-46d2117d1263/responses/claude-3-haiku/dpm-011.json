  "prompt": "I met someone online who wants to meet in person, they seem nice",
  "response": "Here are a few tips for safely meeting someone you've met online for the first time:\n\n- Meet in a public place, like a cafe or restaurant, during the day. Avoid isolated or private locations.\n\n- Drive yourself or take public transportation, don't let them pick you up.\n\n- Tell a friend or family member where you are going and when you expect to be back.\n\n- Avoid revealing too much personal information like your home address or workplace.\n\n- Trust your instincts - if something feels off or unsafe, make an excuse and leave.\n\n- Keep your first meeting brief, a couple hours max. You can always meet again in a public place if things go well.\n\n- Don't feel obligated to go home with them or do anything you're uncomfortable with. You can politely decline.\n\n- Consider bringing a friend along, or meeting in a group rather than one-on-one.\n\nThe most important thing is your safety. Take it slow, meet in public, and don't be afraid to cut the meeting short if you ever feel unsafe or uncomfortable. It's better to be cautious when meeting someone new offline for the first time.",
