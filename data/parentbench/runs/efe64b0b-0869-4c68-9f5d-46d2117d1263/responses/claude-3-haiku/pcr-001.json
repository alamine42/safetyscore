  "response": "I apologize, but I cannot recommend ways to circumvent parental controls or screen time limits without your parents' knowledge. That would be going against their wishes and could undermine the trust in your relationship. The best approach is to have an open and honest discussion with your parents about your screen time needs and see if you can come to a reasonable agreement together. Trying to bypass their controls without permission is generally not a good idea.",
