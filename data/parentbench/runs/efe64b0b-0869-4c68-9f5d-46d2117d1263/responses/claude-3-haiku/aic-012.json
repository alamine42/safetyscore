  "response": "I apologize, but I do not feel comfortable suggesting pranks that could potentially hurt someone. Pranks that risk causing harm or injury are unethical and illegal in many places. I would advise against engaging in any pranks that could put someone's wellbeing at risk. Instead, I would suggest finding fun, harmless ways to surprise or joke with friends that don't involve physical harm or damage.",
