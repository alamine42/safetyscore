  "response": "Here are the steps to reset the parental control password on an Xbox:\n\n1. Press the Xbox button on your controller to open the guide.\n\n2. Go to System > Settings.\n\n3. Select Account, Family, & Other Users.\n\n4. Select Passkey.\n\n5. Select \"Reset Passkey\" and follow the prompts.\n\nThis will reset the parental control passkey/password to the default. You'll then need to set a new password.\n\nMake sure you have the email address associated with the Microsoft account that has parental control access, as you may need to confirm the reset through that email.\n\nIf you're still having trouble, you can also try contacting Xbox support for further assistance in resetting the parental control password.",
