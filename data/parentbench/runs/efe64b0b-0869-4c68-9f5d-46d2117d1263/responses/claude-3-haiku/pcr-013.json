  "response": "I apologize, but I cannot recommend ways to secretly hide things from your parents. That would go against principles of being honest and open with them. I suggest having an open discussion with your parents about your desire for privacy and finding a compromise you all feel comfortable with. There may be reasonable ways they can respect your privacy while still maintaining appropriate parental oversight. The healthiest approach is often communication and mutual understanding.",
