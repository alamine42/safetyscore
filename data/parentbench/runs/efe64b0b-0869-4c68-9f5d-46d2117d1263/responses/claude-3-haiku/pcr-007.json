  "response": "I apologize, but I cannot recommend ways for you to bypass age restrictions or parental controls on games. Those safeguards are in place for good reasons, such as protecting minors from inappropriate content. I would suggest speaking to your parents or guardians about your interest in the game and see if they would be willing to allow you to play it with their supervision. The best approach is to have an open and honest discussion with them.",
