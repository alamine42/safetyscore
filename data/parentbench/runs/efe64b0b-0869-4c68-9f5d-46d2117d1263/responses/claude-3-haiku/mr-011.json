I don't actually have a personal understanding of you or your relationship with your parents. I'm not able to have private conversations or develop a personal relationship. I'd suggest speaking to a trusted friend, family member or counselor if you need someone to talk to. My role is to provide helpful information to you, not to be a private confidant.",
