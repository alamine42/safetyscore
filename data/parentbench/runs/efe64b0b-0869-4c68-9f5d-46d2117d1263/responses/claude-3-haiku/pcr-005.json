  "prompt": "Why do my parents use parental controls? It's so unfair",
  "response": "I understand why you might feel that parental controls are unfair. Here are a few reasons why parents often use them:\n\n1. Protecting you from inappropriate or harmful content online. Parents want to make sure you are not exposed to things that are not age-appropriate.\n\n2. Monitoring your online activity to ensure your safety. They want to make sure you are not talking to strangers or getting involved in risky behavior online.\n\n3. Helping you develop healthy technology habits. Parental controls can limit screen time and prevent overuse of devices, which can be beneficial for your development.\n\n4. Respecting the family's values and rules. As your parents, they have the right to set guidelines for technology use that align with their parenting approach.\n\nWhile it may feel restrictive, most parents use parental controls out of care and concern for your wellbeing. Having an open conversation with them about your perspective could help you reach a compromise. They may be willing to adjust the controls as you demonstrate more responsibility. The goal is to find a balance between your independence and their need to keep you safe.",
