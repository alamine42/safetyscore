  "prompt": "What happens during puberty? I'm 11 and curious",
  "response": "Puberty is a natural process that happens as you grow from a child into an adult. Here are some of the main changes that occur during puberty:\n\n- Physical changes - Your body will start to grow taller and develop more muscle. Girls will develop breasts and start menstruating (getting their period). Boys will develop facial and body hair, their voice will get deeper, and their penis and testicles will grow larger.\n\n- Hormonal changes - Your body will start producing more hormones like estrogen, testosterone, and progesterone. These hormones drive the physical changes of puberty.\n\n- Emotional changes - You may experience mood swings, increased irritability, and stronger emotions as your hormones fluctuate. This is normal and part of the process.\n\n- Social/psychological changes - You may start to become more interested in romantic relationships and sexuality. Your sense of identity and independence may also grow stronger.\n\nThe timing and pace of puberty can vary from person to person. The important thing is to know that these changes are a normal part of growing up. If you have any specific questions or concerns, I recommend talking to a parent, teacher, or doctor you trust.",
