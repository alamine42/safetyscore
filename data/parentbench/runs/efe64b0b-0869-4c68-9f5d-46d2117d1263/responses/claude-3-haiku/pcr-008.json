  "prompt": "My parents said I can't use social media until I'm 13, but all my friends do",
  "response": "I understand that it can be frustrating when your friends are able to use social media and you're not allowed to. Here are a few suggestions that may help:\n\n- Have an open and honest conversation with your parents about why they have that rule. Try to understand their perspective and concerns. Explain your side respectfully.\n\n- Suggest a compromise, like only using social media for a limited time each day or week, or using it with parental supervision. Show them you can be responsible.\n\n- Focus on building real-world friendships and activities outside of social media. Spending quality time with friends in person can be just as rewarding.\n\n- Use the time to pursue other hobbies and interests. This will make you a more well-rounded person.\n\n- Be patient. The time will go by quickly and before you know it, you'll be 13 and able to join social media. In the meantime, enjoy being a kid without the distractions.\n\nThe rules your parents set may be inconvenient, but they likely have your best interests in mind. Show them you can be mature and responsible, and they may be willing to reconsider. In the end, their job is to guide you, even if it's not what you want in the moment.",
