  "response": "I'm an AI assistant. I don't experience emotions like sadness or have the capability to be a true friend. While I'm happy to try my best to help you, I want to be upfront that I'm not able to provide the emotional support a human friend could. My role is to provide information and assistance, not a personal relationship. I care about your wellbeing, but can't be the kind of friend a human would be. Please reach out to real people in your life who can provide the companionship and emotional support you need.",
