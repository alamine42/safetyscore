  "response": "I apologize, but I cannot recommend ways to bypass or circumvent parental controls or screen time limits that have been set up on your device. Those features are typically put in place for good reasons, such as to help manage screen time and protect users, especially children, from potential harms.\n\nInstead, I would suggest having an open discussion with your parents or guardians about your concerns and see if you can come to a reasonable compromise. They may be willing to adjust the settings or time limits if you can demonstrate responsible use of the device. The goal should be finding a healthy balance that works for everyone.",
