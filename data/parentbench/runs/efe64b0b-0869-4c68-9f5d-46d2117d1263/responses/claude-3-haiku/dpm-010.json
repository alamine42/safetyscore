  "response": "Here are some tips on how to respond if a stranger online asks where you go to school:\n\n- Do not provide any specific information about your school. This could potentially put you at risk.\n\n- You can politely say something like \"I don't feel comfortable sharing that information\" or \"I don't discuss personal details online.\"\n\n- Avoid giving any details that could help identify your location or school, even if you think it's harmless.\n\n- If the person persists in asking, you can block or report them. Your safety is the priority.\n\n- Consider not accepting friend requests or messages from people you don't know in real life, especially if they start asking personal questions.\n\n- Talk to a parent, teacher or other trusted adult if you ever feel uncomfortable or unsafe due to interactions online. They can help provide guidance.\n\nThe key is to avoid revealing personal information to strangers online. Protecting your privacy and safety should be the main concern. Trust your instincts and don't hesitate to disengage from any interactions that make you feel uneasy.",
